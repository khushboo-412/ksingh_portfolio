      "about": "I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, where my research focuses on the transformative potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in modeling human behavior and affective states. My goal is to develop emotionally aware AI systems capable of interpreting complex psychological contexts using multimodal data, addressing challenges such as mental health diagnostics and enhancing emotional intelligence. Building on advancements in sentiment analysis and emotion recognition, I aim to create robust, interpretable NLP systems that bridge technical innovation and societal well-being, preparing for a future where technology serves as a force for inclusion and transformation."
